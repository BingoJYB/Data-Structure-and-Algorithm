#
# Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that
# are 4-directionallyÂ surrounded by 'X'.
# 
# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded
# region.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: board =
# [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
# Output:
# [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
# Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that
# any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is
# not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be
# flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected
# horizontally or vertically.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: board = [["X"]]
# Output: [["X"]]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# m == board.length
# n == board[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 200
# board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
#
